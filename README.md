# SuperSpruce-Card-Game
A deckbuilding game inspired by Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle! The goal of the game is to get as far as possible and get as high of a score as possible before the villains inevitably take all your lives.

NEW in v1.1: When you run out of lives, you now get rubies, sapphires, and emeralds based on how well you have done in various mechanics of the game. These currencies can be spent on upgrades to boost all of your future runs! There are 29 upgrades in all! Additionally, there are 3 new cards, 3 new villains, and 7 new villain moves!

See if you can beat my highscore of 22,960, or live for 100 turns!
